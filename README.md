## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation means building your website so it works perfectly when everythingâ€™s going right, but still works okay when things go wrong such as if the internet is slow or not working. Service workers help with this by saving parts of the website (i.e images and styles) on your computer. So even if you're offline, the website can still load and work because it uses what was saved earlier. It makes the site more reliable no matter what kind of connection you have.
